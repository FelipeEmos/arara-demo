# Arara
The highly reactive Animation Library for SolidJS
- Signal Based Animations
- Compose signals to create new exciting animations and emergent behaviors
- Use it to power any Javascript code...
  - DOM maniplations / renders
  - Three JS scenes
- Under the hood it
  - Uses the best animation API for performance in this use case: RAF (*request animation frame*)
  - Uses `gl-matrix` for vector math

# Arara Demo

## Run the demo

```bash
# install deps
bun install

# run dev server
bun dev
```

## Final considerations

This is a SolidStart project for convenience of the Hackathon. A better project structre, with proper package publishing and documentation, is needed in the future.

Here you will find
- The proper **library** code inside the `src/lib` folder!
- Some routes with demos.
